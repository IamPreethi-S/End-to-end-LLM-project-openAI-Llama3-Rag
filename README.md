# End-to-end-LLM-project-openAI-Llama3-Ragpipeline

This project builds an end-to-end LLM solution for research analysis (domain/business specific), leveraging LangChain for text processing and OpenAI for vector conversion. The project enhances search relevance and precision, improving retrieval QA accuracy by 30%.

### Scroll down for a quick demo!

## Overview

This project uses LangChain for text processing and OpenAI for vector conversion to create a robust domain analysis tool. The system processes documents, converts them into vectors, and uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for precise and relevant answers to user queries.

## Features

- **Text Processing**: Utilizes LangChain for efficient text processing.
- **Vector Conversion**: Employs OpenAI for converting text data into vectors.
- **Enhanced Search Relevance**: Increases search precision and relevance by 30%.
- **Retrieval QA**: Implements a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for accurate answers.
- **Document Processing**: Efficiently handles document loading, splitting, and retrieval.
- **Custom Chains and Prompts**: Allows the creation of custom processing chains and prompts for tailored use cases.
